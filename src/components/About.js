            Hi there! My name is Holly Wheeler, and I am a full stack software
            engineer based in Oakland, California.

            I started my career in tech a few months after graduating college in
            2018. I started as an ads analyst at MoPub, a subsidiary of Twitter
            at the time. I continued to do policy work for a few years, joining
            the Twitter side of the business in 2019. In 2021, I moved into a
            learning and development role on the policy team I had been working
            for, and found I had a passion for training. After leadership
            changed hands, I survived several rounds of layoffs, but was
            unfortunately laid off in 2023.

            I took this as an opportunity to re-evaluate my career path. I liked
            training and policy, but I wasn`t sure I wanted to do them forever.
            I had worked with engineers and was constantly impressed by the
            things they could build, so I decided to try a free self-paced
            Python course. That course opened my eyes to the beauty and fun of
            coding, and I couldn`t stop there. I enrolled in a full-time
            software engineering bootcamp run by Flatiron School, where I
            learned JavaScript, React, Python, and Flask, along with HTML and
            CSS.

            My time in policy and training gave me a deeper appreciation and
            consideration for the user experience. This consideration heavily
            affects the way I code â€“ making sure things are user friendly and
            accessible is one of my top priorities whenever I start a new
            project.
